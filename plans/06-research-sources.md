## Key Insights from Research

### Go Blockchain Development
- Cosmos SDK is the most mature framework for building custom Layer-1 blockchains in Go
- Tendermint/CometBFT provides production-ready BFT consensus with 200+ chains in production
- ABCI interface allows clean separation between consensus and application layers

### Python VM Options
- **Starlark-go**: Recommended for production due to determinism, security, and no GIL
- **Embedded CPython**: Provides full Python but requires careful handling of non-determinism and GIL
- Trade-off: Python subset vs. full language support

### Smart Contract VM Requirements
- Gas metering essential for DoS prevention and resource management
- Determinism critical for consensus - same input must produce same output across all nodes
- Sandboxing required to prevent malicious code from compromising node security

### IPFS Integration Best Practices
- Always encrypt sensitive data before uploading to IPFS
- Store CIDs on-chain, not the actual file content
- Use pinning services or incentivized pinning for data availability
- Content addressing provides immutability and deduplication

### Security Considerations
- Python's GIL limits parallel execution in embedded CPython
- Floating-point operations can be non-deterministic across architectures
- Key management is critical for encrypted IPFS storage
- Smart contract auditing and testing essential before production

## Research Methodology

This research was conducted through:
1. Web searches for current state-of-the-art technologies
2. Analysis of production blockchain implementations
3. Review of academic papers on blockchain architecture
4. Examination of existing Python smart contract platforms
5. Investigation of IPFS and encryption integration patterns
6. Study of Go embedding options for Python interpreters
